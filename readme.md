# DevOps Interview Task

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. We need to deploy a new .NET Core Web API application using a docker container.

Write code to do the following:

1. Run the automated tests
2. Package the application as a docker image
3. Deploy and run the image locally or in a public cloud

Improvements can also be made. For example:

- Make any changes to the application you think are useful for a deploy process
- Host the application in a secure fashion

The application is included under [`.\super-service`](`.\super-service`).

Your solution should be triggered by a powershell script called `Deploy.ps1`.

## Submitting

Create a Git repository which includes instructions on how to run the solution.
